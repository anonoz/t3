# Tac Tic Toe

MMU project, please don't copy if you are doing one too, the way I do my tac tic toe can be drastically different from how you do it.

## Compiling

Presuming you have SFML-2.1 in your C:/ and MinGW 4.8.1 installed. You can just run `make.bat` in project root folder to compile what you need.
